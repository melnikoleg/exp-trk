# Protected Routes Implementation

## Changes Made

1. **Created Dedicated Route Protection**

   - Implemented `PrivateRoute` component in `src/routes/PrivateRoute.tsx`
   - Uses React Router's `Navigate` and `Outlet` components to protect routes
   - Stores previous location for post-login redirect

2. **Authentication Flow**

   - Added authentication initialization in `src/utils/auth.ts`
   - Updated login flow to redirect back to originally requested page
   - Added proper logout functionality with both frontend and API cleanup

3. **Protected Routes**

   - Protected the main expense table page (`/`)
   - Protected the user profile page (`/profile`)
   - All protected pages are now wrapped with `<PrivateRoute>` component

4. **User-Specific Data**

   - Updated expense fetching to ensure data is tied to the authenticated user
   - Added proper auth token handling in API calls
   - Implemented user profile page with user-specific information

5. **UI Improvements**
   - Added header with profile menu dropdown
   - Added logout functionality to both header and profile page
   - Improved navigation between protected and public routes

## How It Works

1. When the application loads, it checks for an existing token and validates it
2. If a valid token exists, the user is authenticated and can access protected routes
3. If authentication fails, users are redirected to the login page
4. After successful login, users are redirected to their originally requested page
5. Each user can only see their own expense data

## Next Steps

- Consider implementing refresh token functionality for extended sessions
- Add more user profile management features (update profile, change password, etc.)
- Implement role-based permissions if needed in the future
- Add additional security measures like token expiration handling
